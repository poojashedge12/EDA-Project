# EDA-Project

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, I analyze a dataset containing information on various grocery products. The primary goal is to uncover insights that can inform business strategies, marketing decisions, and product offerings. By exploring patterns, distributions, and relationships within the grocery product data, I aim to contribute to data-driven decision-making.
